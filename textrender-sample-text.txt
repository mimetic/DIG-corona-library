<p>The caudal fin is elongate, and lacks a lower lobe altogether. This species is an active, strong swimming shark, often observed moving with an undulating motion. They are known to form large schools, occasionally aggregating with gray or brown smooth-hound sharks (<em>Mustelus californicus</em> and <em>M. henlei</em>) and piked dogfish (<em>Squalus acanthias</em>).</p>
